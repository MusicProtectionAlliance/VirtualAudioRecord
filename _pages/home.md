eVue Digital Labs is an Open R&amp;D firm with disciplines in evidence informatics, digital forensics, electrotechnology, machine learning and AI.

We build simple algorithms for building trust in machines through rule, evidence and process automation recognition and assessment.

For emerging technologies, such as hardware and software systems based on blockchain protocols, distributed ledgers and IoT device networks, we aim to equip machine and software logic with simple building blocks and tools that aid in providing automated substantiation of truth, trust and authenticity in the shared information and decision making processes that form ecosystems and products impacting society.
