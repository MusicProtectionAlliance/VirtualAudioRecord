<h4 style="text-align: left"><strong>The Process of Grounding</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>evidence.report</em> is a project to build automated plugins for transforming <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://research.it.uts.edu.au/magic/Mary-Anne/MyPapers/Representation=GroundedInformation.pdf">grounded information</a></span></strong> into digital evidence which will be packaged in formats following required program evidence reporting. <span class="a">The main challenge is how to discover how to make repre</span><span class="a">sentations from information so that we can build artificially intelligent systems that </span><span class="a">can do it. </span></p>
<p class="ff6" style="text-align: left"><span class="a">For humans, <span class="l7">a representation is <span class="l6">the result of <span class="l8">grounding information where </span></span></span></span><span class="a">grounding involves </span><em><span class="a">making sense </span></em><span class="a"><em>of information</em>. Not only <span class="l6">do humans <span class="l7">make sense <span class="l8">of </span></span></span></span><span class="a">raw information from sensors, but we are aware we do it, and are even conscious of </span><span class="a">some of our representation making. Unfortunately, we are not typically aware of </span><span class="a">how</span><span class="a"> </span><span class="a">we do it and as a result trying to replicate it in artificial systems is a challenge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We ground information with our methodology of converting existing program documentation into a semantic grounded semantic language structure. This requires human intelligence. This cannot ever be done via machine learning. Subsequent of the grounding phase, neural networks can become cognitively more intelligent than a human by taking an etic approach to processing, predicting, and modeling decision making for humans.</p>
